## Streamlined Onboarding

BroadwayShows offers a streamlined entry for users, enabling browsing with optional authentication. A straightforward sign-in or sign-up via Auth0 is available. Once authenticated, authorized users gain access to a single-page interface for database editing and comprehensive CRUD operations. This user-friendly design ensures seamless navigation and secure, efficient data access.

## Efficient Communication & Team Dynamics

The BroadwayShows project, with its focus on effective teamwork and communication, now incorporates an Azure SQL database for enhanced data management. This update enhances areas such as Blazor Server connections, C# Library and API, user authentication via Auth0, and website design elements. The team continues to use agile methodologies and regular meetings for synchronized progress and efficient problem-solving, with the integration of Azure SQL database adding a new dimension to their SQL server management strategies.

## Secure Data Transfer

Security is paramount in the BroadwayShows application. It leverages HTTPS, provided by Azure Web Services at https://broadwayshows.azurewebsites.net/, for secure communication, ensuring encrypted data transfer and user interaction protection. Additionally, the application integrates robust authentication protocols through Auth0, enhancing data integrity and overall security.
